2. Creating POST and GET request
-Use this site to test fake API 
https://reqres.in/
- Create "GET" request under basic end point test folder==> https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2
	Check the status-200 Success and response

- Create "POST" request under same folder, add the row json data we need to add into server  ====> https://reqres.in/api/users
	Check status-201 Created and response
- Create "GET" request by coping the initial GET request and test for specific id by appending the ===> https://reqres.in//api/users/{{valid_id}}

------------------------

3. Create PUT and DELETE request
- "PUT" request- upodate the data into existing one===> https://reqres.in//api/users/{{valid_id}}
	write the json format data into the body of it
	Status- 204 No Content and no response
	Then check the GET request for user id which we updated previously
-"DELETE" request- delete the contents ===> https://reqres.in//api/users/{{valid_id}}
	Status- 204 No Content and no response
	Then check the GET request for user id which we updated previously

5. Using envirnment variables

- Click on Gear icon present on Right top corner of POSTMAN home pahe
- Click on create environment ---give the name "User List"
- Change environment from top (ebnvironment dropdown)
- While creating POST request add those varibles in {{}}, instead of writing the hardcoded value

------------------------------------------------------
6. Saving response data as a variable
- Create "POST" request
- Go to test menu and writr javascript to save response

var jsonData=pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("contactId", jsonData._Id);

- Execute the POST request and see the environment variable grid
- Then check by using GET request by putting ====> https://reqres.in//api/users/{{contactId}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Challenge: Add variables to a request
- Update two requests in the Basic Request Folder to use the {{contactId}} variable 
- Add more variables in your UserList environment file, then use those variables in the body of your POST request 
----------------------------------------------------
8. Solution: Add variables to a request
- Update two requests in the Basic Request Folder to use the {{contactId}} variable 
	We can add into PUT and DELETE request

- Add more variables in your UserList environment file, then use those variables in the body of your POST request 

var jsonData=pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("contactId", jsonData._Id);
pm.environment.set("contactId", jsonData._FirstName);
pm.environment.set("contactId", jsonData._LastName);
pm.environment.set("contactId", jsonData._Email);
pm.environment.set("contactId", jsonData._Company);

- Change the body data accordingly by using {{write the variables}}
